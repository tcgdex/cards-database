## Interact with the Database

The easiest way to interact with the database is by using one of our SDKs _list below_.

You can however build the API yourself by using our [compiler](https://github.com/tcgdex/compiler) or download the already built [compiled database](https://github.com/tcgdex/distribution).

## SDKs (API Wrapper but SDK is way cooler ðŸ˜„)

We currently officially support theses SDKs

- [Javascript/Typescript SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/javascript-sdk)
- [PHP SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/php-sdk)

_If you have a SDK you can start a [discussion](https://github.com/tcgdex/cards-database/discussions/new) to be added here_
