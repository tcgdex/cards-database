# Pokemon TCGdex

A Multilanguage Pok√©mon TCG Database with Pictures and most of the informations contained on the cards

## Use the datas

The easiest way to use the datas is via our [Javascript/Typescript SDK](https://github.com/tcgdex/javascript-sdk).

You can however build this yourself via our [compiler](https://github.com/tcgdex/compiler) or download the already build [compiled database](https://github.com/tcgdex/distribution).
