## Database Issue or recomendation

We would love you to see what you can propose to make the Database/API better !

to do this you can check if there is not already an issue/discussion about it, and if there is nothing, add a new [Issues](https://github.com/tcgdex/cards-database/issues/new) if it's already well though, or [create a new discussion](https://github.com/tcgdex/cards-database/discussions/new) to speak about it

Install the plugin `.editorconfig` in your dev environment if it's not already done and thats it !
