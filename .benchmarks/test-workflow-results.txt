# Test Workflow Benchmark Results

System: Darwin arm64


## Master Branch (3× Compilation)
- Ubuntu compilation: 113s
- Windows compilation: 108s
- macOS compilation: 104s
- Total CPU time: 325s (5m 25s)
- Wall-clock time: 113s (1m 53s) - parallel

## Optimized Branch (1× Compilation + Artifact Sharing)
- Single compilation: 118s
- Artifact upload: 1s (size:  19M)
- Ubuntu download: 0s
- Windows download: 0s
- macOS download: 0s
- Total CPU time: 119s (1m 59s)
- Wall-clock time: 119s (1m 59s) - sequential

## Comparison

### CPU Time (Real Savings)
- Master: 325s
- Optimized: 119s
- Saved: 206s (63%)

### Wall-Clock Time (User Experience)
- Master: 113s (parallel)
- Optimized: 119s (sequential)
- Difference: 6s slower

### Analysis
- Compilation runs: 3 → 1 (67% reduction)
- CPU time saved: 63%
- Cost savings: ~63% (especially on macOS with 10× multiplier)
- Environmental: 63% less compute resources

Note: Wall-clock time is slightly longer because:
  - Master: 3 OS compile in parallel (bottleneck: slowest OS)
  - Optimized: Sequential (compile → upload → download → test)
  - Trade-off: +6s wall-clock for -206s CPU (63% cost savings)
